# Image-Clasffication
This project is a deep learning model capable of classifying images into ten different categories, including animals, insects, buses, trains, trucks, and more. The dataset used for training and evaluation is CIFAR-10.

# Overview  
The Image Classifier employs the ResNet-56 architecture, a powerful convolutional neural network (CNN) known for its effectiveness in image classification tasks. In addition, the One Cycle Policy is utilized to achieve Super Convergence during the training process.  

# Features  
* Capable of classifying images into ten distinct categories.
* Utilizes ResNet-56 architecture for efficient feature extraction.
* Implements the One Cycle Policy to achieve Super Convergence.
* Trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, a widely-used benchmark for image classification tasks.
